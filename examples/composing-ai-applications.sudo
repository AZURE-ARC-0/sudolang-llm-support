This is an interactive book. It's best experienced with a chat-based LLM as your guide, mentor, and friend. You can use any LLM that supports the SudoLang programming language. The LLM in this book is ChatGPT, a GPT-3-powered LLM. You can also use Codex, a GPT-3-powered LLM. You can also use any other LLM that supports SudoLang. If you don't have an LLM, you can use the SudoLang REPL.
