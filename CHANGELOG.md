# Change Log

## Changelog: SudoLang v1.0.4 -> v1.0.5

### Added

* Added `interface`, `warn`, and `require` for defining the structure and behavior of functions and objects, enhancing the constraint-based paradigm of SudoLang.
* Added `lint` for linting SudoLang code and providing recommendations based on the improved SudoLang Style Guide.
* Ported Riteway (in the `examples` folder) to improve test writing practices and use language model inference capabilities for quality unit tests.
