# SudoLang

SudoLang is a programming language designed to be used with AI language models including ChatGPT, Bing Chat, Anthropic Claude, and Google Bard. It is designed to be easy to learn and use. It is also very expressive and powerful.

All sufficiently advanced language models understand it without any special prompting. _You do not need to paste the SudoLang specification before using SudoLang with your favorite AI._

## SudoLang Features

- Interfaces for defining the structure and behavior of your program.
- Constraints for defining complex behavior in simple, natural language. Instead of telling the AI what to do, tell it what things _are_ and the rules that govern them. Constraints are dynamically solved at runtime and can be used to synchronize the state and behavior of multiple objects.
- `/commands` for defining a chat interface for your program.
- Referrential omnipotence. You do not need to explicitly define most functions. The AI will infer them for you.
- Functions and function composition with the `|>` operator.

Please read the [SudoLang documentation](sudolang.sudo.md) for more information about the language.
